<h2> Game Pieces </h2>

<h3> Soldiers </h3>
In order to win in a battle, the player must gather soldiers in order to have
a greater probability of winning! Soldiers can be obtained through regu-
lar gathering, Cards or Gambling. You must have equal than or a
greater amount of food to keep your soldiers.
Ex. If you have 100 Soldiers and 90 Food by the end of your turn, you
will lose 10 soldiers.


<h3> Food </h3>
Food is an essential part of the game in order to keep soldiers! Every turn
your soldiers will a eat a portion of the food. That amount is determined by
the population of soldiers. Food can be obtained through regular gathering,
Cards or Gambling.

<h3> Heroes </h3>
Heroes are wonderful companions! They boost your soldier size by 10 percent
when engaged in a battle. They can only be obtained through Cards.


<h3> Spies </h3>
Spies are good to have on your side. They lower your enemy’s soldier size by
10 percent when in battle. They can only be obtained through Cards.


<h2> Instructions </h2>

The goal of the game is to defeat all the enemies and rule over all the land!

<h3> The Beginning </h3>
When running the game you will be asked to name your Kingdom. Name it
something the enemy will fear! After you name your Kingdom, you and the
other AI players will placed in a random order of turns.

<h3> Turns </h3>
Each player will take turns according to the random order. In the very
beginning of each player’s turn, the soldiers will eat food. The amount is
determined by the population of the soldiers. After, the player will be pre-
sented with a series of options. A player can only choose one option per turn.

<ul>
  <li>Invade </li>
  <li>Choose a card </li>
  <li>Farm 30 Food </li>
  <li>Raise 30 Soliders </li>
  <li>Random Gamble </li>
</ul>


After the turn is over, the amount of Food must be equal than or greater
than the amount of your Soldiers. If your have more Soldiers than food, you
will lose the amount of soldiers minus food.

<h3> Invasion </h3>
Invasion: invade a land! An AI player can also declare war on you. When you initate an invasion, you and the opponent place your soldiers on the battlefield and roll a die. The amount of soldiers you have and the higher roll determine if you will win.

<h3> Cards </h3>
When a player chooses to pick a random card, there is a probability of picking
one out of fifteen possible cards. Each card is different and can be positive
or negative towards your Kingdom. This is the only way to get Spies and
Heroes.

<h3> Gamble </h3>
When a player chooses to Gamble, they will go to a pub to dice with other
Lords. They cannot lose any items, but it can be a waste of a turn if they
lose!
